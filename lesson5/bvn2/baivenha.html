        SMILEY: Hi, Lia. What seems to be the problem today?
        <br />
        LIA: I hope you can tell me! A chunk of my tooth broke off yesterday.
        <br />
        SMILEY: That‚Äôs not good. Did you bite something hard?
        <br />
        LIA: No, I didn‚Äôt . . . that‚Äôs the weird thing. It just kind of fell
        out.
        <br />
        SMILEY: Did it hurt when it broke?
        <br />
        LIA: Yes, it did, just a little; but it started to hurt like crazy this
        morning.
        <br />
        SMILEY: I think we‚Äôd better take a full set of X-rays . . . Okay, open
        wide. Let me take a look. Oh, boy. Yes, it looks like you‚Äôve exposed the
        root on your left, molar.
        <br />
        LIA: rgscht rfghsh!! ghs gtfhhkj?
        <br />
        SMILEY: Sorry. I‚Äôll be done in a minute. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll have to have
        a root canal. I can put in a temporary filling, but you‚Äôll have to come
        back in two weeks for the procedure.
        <br />
        LIA: Do I have to have a root canal? My tooth doesn‚Äôt really hurt too
        much.
        <br />
        SMILEY: If we don‚Äôt take care of this quickly, it may become infected,
        and it will hurt a lot. I‚Äôll tell Dina to set up an appointment, and
        I‚Äôll see you back here in two weeks, on Tuesday, the 14th, at 3 p.m.
        <br />
        LIA: Will the procedure hurt?
        <br />
        SMILEY: I‚Äôll give you medication so that you won‚Äôt feel any pain. Relax!
        It‚Äôs not so bad!
